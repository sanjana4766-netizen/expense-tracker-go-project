# Project Structure

This project follows a simple file-based organization suitable for a small backend service.

* main.go — Application entry point and routing setup
* models.go — Data structures representing core entities
* handlers.go — HTTP request handlers for API endpoints
* settlement.go — Logic for computing optimal settlements
* README.md — Overview and usage instructions
* DESIGN.md — Architectural description
* ENGINEERING_NOTES.md — Implementation rationale
* go.mod / go.sum — Dependency configuration

The structure is intentionally minimal to keep the project easy to navigate and understand.
